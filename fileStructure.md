Root Directory:

The main .gitignore file is created here, covering common files and directories to ignore across the entire project.

nutriverse-client (Next.js + React):

We use create-next-app to set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and ESLint.
The package.json file is automatically created by this command.
Configuration files like next.config.js are also created automatically.

nutriverse-api (Nest.js):

We use the Nest CLI to create a new Nest.js project.
The package.json file is automatically created.
We also install the @nestjs/dynamodb package for DynamoDB integration.
Configuration files are created in the src directory.

nutriverse-ml:

A basic structure is set up for machine learning models, data processing, and Jupyter notebooks.
A requirements.txt file is created for Python dependencies.

Directories are created for database schemas, migrations, and seed data.
